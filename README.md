In this course, we introduce the mathematics at the heart of many ideas of computer science: discrete math. The above animation from a [great article on coloring theorems](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-closer-to-perfect-graph-coloring-theorem-20151020/) captures our course goal: understanding the connections between discrete mathematics and computer science.
