These are some articles that I've found helpful and insightful while thinking about the bonus problems.

* [Graph thickness](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GraphThickness.html)
* [The Thickness and Chromatic Number of r-Inflated Graphs](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.615.5026&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
* [Thickness-Two Graphs Part One: New Nine-Critical Graphs, Permuted Layer Graphs, and Catlinâ€™s Graphs](https://academics.hamilton.edu/mathematics/dboutin/ThicknessTwo.pdf)
* [Thickness and Colorability of Geometric Graphs](http://www.cs.umanitoba.ca/~durocher/research/pubs/durocherWG2013.pdf)
