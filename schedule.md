# CSCI 2824 Calendar

**Notes**:
- All assignments are due when they are listed on their document (unless prior approval has been received). Q is for quizzes, HW for regular homeworks, and P for projects.
- Reading assignments are from _Discrete Mathematics With Applications, 5th Ed._ by Epp; They are strongly encouraged but you are welcome to read any text that helps you. You are expected to have some understanding of the linked questions for that day.
